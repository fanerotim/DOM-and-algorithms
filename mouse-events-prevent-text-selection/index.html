            It was a soothing monastic monotony, a balm for troubled souls, to know your purpose, follow an itinerary
            and bring the gang back, tired and satisfied after another day of fulfilling your mission. The days were
            beads in a rosary that passed through your fingers and you felt their texture and shape. The same, but
            different.

            Morning prayer: milk the sheep and take the flock to pasture. Midday prayer: pladnina. Evening vespers:
            bring the flock home, feed the dogs. Have a humble supper, lie on your hard bed, then rise early and morning
            prayer.

            Drink your coffee, lace up your shoes, strap on your rucksack, take your stick and in sickness and in
            health, in rain and sunshine, go. The dogs are waiting. The flock is waiting. The hills are waiting. You are
            needed.
