Slider

Create a slider (demo provided in the link above);

Drag the blue thumb with the mouse and move it (related to provided demo).

Important details:

When the mouse button is pressed, during the dragging the mouse may go over or below the slider. The slider will still work (convenient for the user).
If the mouse moves very fast to the left or to the right, the thumb should stop exactly at the edge.
